00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,379
and I'm delighted to be in this vibrant region.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,519
I have experience working on the investment side within a

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,929
family office and enjoy working with single and multi family

6
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,719
offices as well as wealthy families. We take a

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,739
consultative approach to helping our client's solve the challenges they

8
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,740
face, whether it's thinking about starting a new family

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,880
office, executing an investment policy statement, meeting complex

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,299

11
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:43,689

best practices. As an example, I organize dinners

around the region for families interested in networking around direct

16
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,539

17
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:04,620

00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,640
